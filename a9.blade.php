  <strong>COMPUTER</strong><br><br><br><br>
  <a href="#top">GO TO TOP</a><br><br><br><br>
  <p>a computer is a general purpose device that can beprogramed to carry out a set of arithmaticor logical operations.Since a sequence of operations can be readily changedthe computer can solve more than onekind of problem. </p>
  <p><strong>cpu</strong></p>
  <p>A central processing unit also known ascentral processor unit is the hardwarewithin a computer that carries out the instructions of a  computer program by performing the basic arithmatical,logical and input/output operations of thesystem.The term has been in use in the computer industry atleast since the early 1960s.The form,design and the implementation of cpu have changed over the course of their history.But their fundamental operations remains much the same</p>
  <h4><strong>ALU</strong></h4>
  <p>In computing an arithmatic andlogica unit is a digital circuit that performs integer,arithmatic and logic operations.The ALU is a fundamental buiding block of CPU of a computer and even the simplest microprocessor contain one of the purpose of such as maintaining timers. the processors found inside modern CPUs the graphic processing unit(GPUs) accomodatevery powerful and very complex ALUs; Asimple component may contain number of ALUs</p>
